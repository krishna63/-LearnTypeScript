# Typescript
Hello Everyone, Lets have some fun by learning Typescript!!! :smiley:

## QuickLinks:

#### What is Typescript ?
<p>
  A _superset of Javascript_ which compiles to plain Javascript. It can run in any browser and any OS.
  In other words it is an **improved version of Javascrript**.
</p>

#### Why do we need Typescript and main features of the language ?
  
  1) Typescript helps us auto detecting the problems at __compile time rather than at run time__.  
    ```
        const notModifiable = "Typescript";
        notModifiable = "Javascript"
    ```
  2) It also helps in autosuggest out of the box or definations of the variables.
  3) It infers type inference automatically for the variables declaration.


#### What are the prelimany things for learning Typescript ?
